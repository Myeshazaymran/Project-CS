The issue we are aiming to resolve is around the use of passwords for websites, accounts etc. Passwords are an outdated method to authenticate one's identity and gain access to your account. We're aiming to create a facial recognition system, similar to the Apple IOS system. This eradicates issues associated with password protection/security and ensures that no hackers can gain access to one's private data.
